                            the
                            hallmark of many of the world’s most successful brands – setting the bar for organizations
                            across
                            all industries to prioritize their CX, EX &amp; CL strategies and deliver superior
                            experiences
                            across all channels. It’s no secret that over the past two years, customer expectations have
                            evolved
                            – making CX as one of the biggest differentiators between one’s brand and the competition.
                            Two
                            thirds of organizations globally now compete on customer experience alone with 87% of
                            business
                            leaders having identified CX as their top growth engine.
                            The 2nd Annual CX & Loyalty Summit MENA 2023 shifts focus on innovative approaches that the
                            world’s

                            value
                            A stellar line-up featuring leading brands and organizations who have established CX, EX

                            Customer Loyalty at the top of their boardroom agenda will share insights into how digital
                            experiences are transforming the way we work, deliver, transact, communicate, and live in an
                            ever-changing world. With interactive keynote sessions, expert-led panels, and live case
                            studies, we
                            aim to pack value into every minute of the attendee experience, covering the topics that
                            mean the
